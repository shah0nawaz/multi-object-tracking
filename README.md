**NOTE**: _OBJECT DETECTION DATA MUST BE YOLO FORMATTED_

CVDV provides you the full analytics of your object detection dataset formatted according to the YOLO algorithm. The analysis performed using `cvdv` can help you in understanding the dataset. It can identify the class imbalance and bounding box size distribution according to different datasets.
